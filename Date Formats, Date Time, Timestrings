---Expected to work with data contains only the date portion. If a time portion is involved, it gets more complicated---
--- The date you are trying to insert MUST matches the format of date column in database ---
### Dates are stored as DATETYPES. Each DBMS uses it's own variety of datatypes ###

------ Date Formats ------
# DATE --> YYYY-MM-DD #
# DATETIME --> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS #
# TIMESTAMP --> YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS #

---> STRFTIME (String Format Time) used to extract certain elements of a date/time string <---
SELECT Birthdate, STRFTIME('%Y', Birthdate) AS Year
, STRFTIME('%m', Birthdate) AS Month
, STRFTIME('%d', Birthdate) AS Day
FROM employees

------------ Compute current date (Frequently in analysis, you use this to see how many days it has been since a customer submitted an order ----------

SELECT DATE('now')

------------ Compute year, month, and day for the current date ----------
SELECT STRFTIME('%Y %m %d', 'now')

------------ Compute the Hour, Minute and Second and Miliseconds from Current DATETIME ----------
SELECT STRFTIME('%H %M %S %s', 'now');

---------- Compute AGE using birthdate to create it into an Age column ----------
SELECT Birthdate, STRFTIME('%Y, Birthdate) AS Year
, STRFTIME(%m, Birthdate) AS Month
, STRFTIME(%d, Birthdate) AS Day
, DATE(('now')-Birthdate) AS Age
FROM employees
